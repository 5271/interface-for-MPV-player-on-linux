# interface-for-MPV-player-on-linux

This is an interface for MPV player for linux users which don't want to write a command each time they want to watch a video. In order to use it you need to have MPV player installed on your computer. To do that you just need to type this command `sudo apt install mpv` and if you want to watch youtube videos you also need to type `sudo apt install youtube-dl` and it should work. If you have any problems feel free to create an issue. I'm keen to help.

###### Wish you a good experience of watching youtube without all the spyware -w-
